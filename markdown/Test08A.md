#### Question 15: Your are the ScrumMaster for five Scrum teams which have a combined total of three Product Owner. The Scrum teams are assigned to work on different components of the same product. How should you setup the Sprint cycle to execute Scrum?


 1. Each unique combination of Product Owner and Team should have the same Sprint duration and the same start dates.
 2. Each Team should have the same Sprint duration and the same start dates. (CORRECT)
 3. Each unique combination of Product Owner and Team should have the same Sprint duration but different start dates.
 4. Each Team should have the same Sprint duration but different start dates.

##### Explain:

> In this scenario, everyone should be on the same Sprint duration with the same dates because it is the same product. It does not matter how many Scrum teams exist or how many Product Owners exist. This is a scenario in which the company is multi-tasking rather than sequentially building each product component.

#### Question 16: Which of the following is not a Scrum artifact?


 1. Sprint Backlog
 2. Storycard (CORRECT)
 3. Burndown Chart
 4. Product Backlog

##### Explain:

> A Story card, also known as a Story, is not a scrum artifact. All other items are valid artifacts. Hint: Think like a Scrum Alliance purist.

 4. The Scrum Team assigns the storypoints to a product backlog item after clarifying and refining requirements with the Product Owner. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Scrum Team assigns the storypoints to a product backlog item after clarifying and refining requirements with the Product Owner. All other options are invalid.

#### Question 18: You are the ScrumMaster. The Sprint will complete in two days. Each day of the Sprint is equivalent to 8 hours. The team has just enough time to complete all tasks in the remaining 16 hours with the exception of three tasks. Of these three tasks, two tasks (a total of 6 hours) are required to complete one Product Backlog item and one task (an estimate of 2 hours) is required to complete another Product Backlog item. How should the team handle the remaining three tasks?


 1. The team should negotiate with the Product Owner on the definition of "done".
 2. The team should keep the three tasks on the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint and complete those tasks first.
 3. The team should place the two Product Backlog items back onto the Product Backlog. (CORRECT)
 4. The team should work the extra 8 hours to complete their commitment to the Product Owner.

##### Explain:

> The team should place the two Product Backlog items back onto the Product Backlog. The product Owner must determine what the priority of this unfinished work should be in relation to other prioritized work. Please remember that the team must work at a sustainable pace. Overtime is not a part of Scrum.

#### Question 19: The Sprint time is going to end. Off the 8 items in the Sprint Backlog, only one is completely finished, three items are almost finished, and others are just 50% complete. It’s time for Sprint Review. Team Members believe that they should only demonstrate the one completed item, but the Product Owner believes that they should also demonstrate the three items that are almost finished. What’s the right choice?


 1. The Team Members are right (CORRECT)
 2. The Product Owner is right as near completed products can also be shown
 3. The Product Owner is right, given that they will mention in the Sprint Review that those three items are not completed yet but will be done in the near future

##### Explain:

> Only the 100% “Done” items are to be demonstrated; even the 99.999% doneitems should not be presented to the customer.

#### Question 20: How many software developers met at a Snowbird, Utah resort and published a famous document which defines the methodology now known as Agile software development?


 1. 12
 2. 19
 3. 17 (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> 17 software developers met at a Snowbird, Utah resort and published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development (or Agile Manifesto) which defines the methodology now known as Agile software development.

#### Question 21: How should the Product Backlog arranged?


 1. Product Backlog items should be date sorted in ascending order.
 2. Product Backlog items should be sorted by business priority in descending order. (CORRECT)
 3. Product Backlog items should be sorted by level of effort or complexity in descending order.
 4. Product Backlog items should be grouped by business category or feature.

##### Explain:

> Product Backlog items should be sorted by business priority in descending order. The Product Owner must constantly reprioritize the list as more information is learned.

#### Question 22: Your are the ScrumMaster for five Scrum teams which have a combined total of three Product Owner. The Scrum teams are assigned to work on different components of the same product. When should all of Sprint deliverables be integrated?

 2. Each Scrum Team's deliverables should be integrated prior to Sprint Review.
 3. Each Scrum Team's deliverables should be integrated before a new Sprint starts.
 4. Each Scrum Team's deliverables should be integrated in the last Sprint before final delivery of the product. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> In this scenario, the company is multi-tasking or multi-threading efforts rather than sequentially building each product component. The Product Owners are responsible for making sure that the Product meets business expectations and needs. The Product Owners elect should be able to request an integration as many times as necessary to ensure overall product quality and the integration should definitely occur or recur in the final Sprint as part of the final preparation for shipping or delivering the final product solution.

#### Question 23: In agile, when should you collect lesson learnt?


 1. When projects go poorly
 2. When projects go well
 3. Throughout the project (CORRECT)

 2. Grouped by business features first and then chronologically by date of original business request.
 3. Chronologically by date of original business request first and then by list order in the Product Backlog
 4. Alphabetically by the business unit first and then by list order in the Product Backlog

##### Explain:

> Items in the Product Backlog must be first ordered by priority. If a single scrum team is working on requests from multiple Product Owners representing different business units, then the Product Owner are responsible for determining which Product Backlog Item has the highest priority. If there are multiple items of the same priority, then order of appearance on the list is used.

#### Question 25: ________________ constitute the Sprint Backlog and are often estimated in hours.


 1. Use Cases
 2. Tasks (CORRECT)
 3. Stories
 4. Features

##### Explain:

> Tasks constitute the Sprint Backlog and are often estimated in hours. Alternate choices: Use cases are used for either requirements. A task may be to create use cases.
