# Test02 Answer

#### Question 1: One of the major challenges for the team getting newly into Scrum can be


 1. Difficulty in getting adapted to Scrum tools
 2. Learning about Scrum terminology
 3. Developing skills to produce useable Increment just within a short Sprint

##### Explain:

> Scrum is lightweight with Scrum Teams and their associated simple roles, events, artifacts, and rules. But for new teams, it is difficult to master the skill to produce deployable and useable Increment within short Sprints. Scrum is not associated with any tools.

#### Question 2: Effort required to fix/refactor something after it has been built is known as


 1. Maintenance
 2. Technical Debt
 3. Plumbing code

##### Explain:

> Technical debt is not a concept within Scrum. However, it is commonly used by Scrum Teams to indicate the gap unaddressed in a done Increment.

#### Question 3: In a Scrum based software project, “Earned Value” is a good metric to track product development progress.


 1. No
 2. Yes

##### Explain:

> The real mark of progress in Scrum is  the delivery of useable product Increment in every Sprint.

#### Question 4: In the middle of the Sprint, Development Team finds that few more days of work is needed to complete the scope. The planning options include:


 1. Add more team members
 2. Catch up using weekends
 3. All of the above
 4. Involve the Product Owner and negotiate alternatives
 5. Defer the activities like testing after stakeholder’s demo

##### Explain:

> Scrum events are time boxed. Sprint needs to be over by defined date. However, the scope of the Sprint may expand or contract as more is learned throughout the Sprint. When new issues emerge that threaten the completion of Sprint by pre-set date- As a first step, the team needs to capture this as an issue and try to solve on their own. If they cannot, they should make this impediment transparent and take ScrumMaster’s help. Even after that, if the impediment is not solved, they need to involve the Product Owner to discuss the alternatives.

#### Question 5: A Development Team is often interrupted in the Sprint midway and assigned to work on “other” high priority items. Frequently, such interruptions lead to not meeting the Sprint Goal. The most likely cause could be


 1. The Development Team is not technically competent
 2. The Product Owner authority is ineffective or influenced by another authority
 3. The Sprint Planning is poor

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner is the ultimate authority of the Product Backlog on which the Development Team must work. Those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner. For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. If the Development Team is given different work, it indicates that Product Owner’s authority is interrupted.

#### Question 6: Sprint Planning helps in


 1. Building entire technical architecture
 2. Staffing plan
 3. Testing strategy
 4. Release plan
 5. None of the above

##### Explain:

> Sprint Planning is focused on coming up with Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal. Sprint Backlog consists of scope of work planned for that Sprint and the plan to achieve that scope. Technical architecture is evolved over the Sprints.

#### Question 7: It is mandatory that the definition of “Done” includes “Release to Production”


 1. Yes
 2. No

##### Explain:

> Every Sprint includes producing a potentially releasable working Increment. However, it is Product Owner’s call to release that to production.

#### Question 8: A Development Team has created the Sprint Backlog in the form of a task board. What is your inference?


 1. ScrumMaster must coach the team to create proper Sprint Backlog in the formof list of backlog items, related tasks, and estimations
 2. It is okay to have it in task board format, but it must be ensured that it follows Kanban guidelines
 3. The team can choose to represent it any form that makes sense

##### Explain:

> Sprint Backlog contains the Product Backlog items for the current Sprint, and the plan to complete and realize the Sprint Goal. Scrum does not prescribe any specific format or technique to be followed for representing Sprint Backlog.

#### Question 9: On their kick-off day, a new Scrum Team didn’t have any Scrum tool. The next best thing to do is


 1. Do nothing. Implementation of Scrum does not require any tool
 2. Get the recommendation from Product Owner about how to manage Scrum artifacts without the tool
 3. Expedite the installation of tool before the close of iteration zero

##### Explain:

> Implementation of Scrum does not require any tool.

#### Question 10: The Product Owner provides the transparency of their product plan to the stakeholders and the Scrum Team through


 1. Planning Backlog
 2. Product Backlog
 3. Sprint Backlog
 4. Project Backlog

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner uses Product Backlog to update the stakeholders on the current state of the product plan.

#### Question 11: Usually, when Scrum is applied newly in an organization,


 1. Power of empiricism will be transparent
 2. The organization change management process defined by Scrum should be followed to avoid implementation issues
 3. Everything that impedes producing value in short Sprints and accumulation of waste will be made transparent

##### Explain:

> Scrum will expose all weakness in the current eco-system that need to be resolved. Scrum does not define any organization change management process.

#### Question 12: In empiricism, the decisions are based on


 1. Observation, experience and experimentation
 2. Meeting and Brainstorming
 3. Scientific calculation and Prediction

##### Explain:

> Empiricism is a process control theory in which only the past is accepted as certain and in which decisions are based on observation, experience and experimentation.

#### Question 13: Sprint Planning is the only occasion where the Development Team estimates the Product Backlog items


 1. True, because without estimate, the team cannot plan what can go into the Sprint
 2. False, estimation of Product Backlog Items is a continuous event throughout

##### Explain:

> Every item in Product Backlog needs to have a description, order, value, and estimate. The Product Owner works with Development Team throughout in Backlog Refinement sessions, to refine the backlog items and get the estimate.

#### Question 14: Definition of “Done” is


 1. A standard used by Scrum Team to assess if a product Increment is “done”
 2. Testing strategy for Scrum Team
 3. Defined by Product Owner and safeguarded by ScrumMaster

#### Question 15: The Scrum Team optimizes the following and deliver business value


 1. Self-Improvement, Leadership, Motivation
 2. Individual Power, Heroic Efforts, Recognition
 3. Flexibility, creativity, and productivity

##### Explain:

> The Scrum framework is a collaboration framework within which Scrum Team can creatively and productively deliver business value with quality. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

#### Question 16: Select all that apply. The mandatory participants of the Sprint Retrospective meeting are


 1. Technical/Domain/Process experts invited by Development Team
 2. Development Team
 3. ScrumMaster
 4. Stakeholders invited by Product Owner
 5. Product Owner

##### Explain:

> Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect and adapt the Scrum Team itself.

#### Question 17: Sprint Backlog is modified throughout the Sprint. As soon as a new task is identified,


 1. Product Owner adds it to the Sprint Backlog and communicates about it to Scrum Team
 2. ScrumMaster adds it to the Sprint Backlog and communicates about it to Scrum Team
 3. Development Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog and communicates about it to Scrum Team

##### Explain:

> Development Team is the owner of the Sprint Backlog.

#### Question 18: Scrum framework is used to optimize value and control risk in complex product development. A component of value optimization is


 1. Averaging out the values delivered over Sprints and use it to take decisions
 2. Deciding to continue a Sprint only after verifying if it has enough value worth the effort
 3. Ensuring that the Development Team is not having idle time by constantly monitoring their productivity

##### Explain:

> It is the responsibility of the Product Owner to verify that a Sprint has enough value to worth the effort. They are rigorous value optimizers.

#### Question 19: Only the Product Owner can come up with items that can be considered for Product Backlog. Others cannot provide input/recommendations/ideas about new items


 1. True
 2. False

##### Explain:

> While the Product Owner has the final say on the content and order of the Product Backlog, he can still get the input / recommendations / ideas about new items from any stakeholders for consideration.

#### Question 20: The Development Team is not having regular (Daily) Scrums. As a ScrumMaster, you


 1. Will step in directly to guard the Scrum Framework by asking action-begetting questions to team and positively influencing them to conduct Scrum events
 2. Will advise the team to think about conducting regular Scrums, but will let the team take the decision themselves as they are self-organizing
 3. Will escalate this to resource managers

##### Explain:

> The ScrumMaster does not manage people. They encourage the self-organization of the team to manage its work. However, the ScrumMaster is the guardian of the Scrum framework and hence its rules. Daily Scrum is an opportunity to inspect and adapt daily progress, so that the work related differences are not allowed to go beyond a day. When there is a violation, ScrumMaster actively steps in to coach the team on Scrum.

#### Question 21: The selection of items from the Product Backlog a Development Team deems feasible for implementation in a Sprint is called


 1. Forecast of functionality
 2. Planning Poker
 3. Estimation

#### Question 22: Select all that apply. It is essential for the Product Owner to have these skills.


 1. Understanding and practicing agility
 2. Coaching team
 3. Product planning in empirical environments
 4. Software application development

##### Explain:

> Product Owner must have the understanding to perform product planning in empirical environment, and practicing agility. ScrumMaster serves the Product Owner by coaching them these skills.

#### Question 23: A Development Team has following condition under the definition of “Done”:“All the code to be reviewed and approved by Industry Coding Standard Organization.” This Industry Coding Standard Organization is a third party Subject Matter Expert outside Scrum Team.


 1. The definition of “Done” is less effective, because it contains conditions that is not completely within influence of the Scrum Team
 2. The definition of “Done” can contain anything as decided by Product Owner
 3. The definition of “Done” is more effective, because it ensures that required standards are met

##### Explain:

> The activities required to complete the Product Backlog items to a “done” state should be completely within the ownership and influence of the Scrum Team.

#### Question 24: The estimation method recommended by Scrum is


 1. None of the above
 2. Planning Poker
 3. T-Shirt Sizing
 4. Yesterday’s weather

##### Explain:

> Scrum does not prescribe any specific estimation technique.

#### Question 25: A short expression of the purpose of a Sprint which is often a business need is called


 1. Acceptance Criteria
 2. Definition of Done
 3. Sprint Goal

##### Explain:

> Sprint Goal is the purpose of the Sprint and hence needs to be preserved. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint.

#### Question 26: An Organization needs to structure hundreds of Developers into Scrum Teams. You as a ScrumMaster will


 1. work with the organization management and prepare the best structure for the each Scrum Team based on the seniority and skills of the Developers
 2. identify required number of ScrumMasters and require them to choose theirScrum Teams
 3. facilitate the awareness of the Developers about the goals and objectives of the product development, coach them about Scrum, and let them work among themselves to form the Scrum Teams

##### Explain:

> Scrum Teams are self-organized teams. Given the knowledge of the product vision and sound understanding of how Scrum works, the team is knowledgeable enough to form themselves into Scrum Teams. A ScrumMaster needs to facilitate this.

#### Question 27: The ScrumMaster manages


 1. All of them
 2. Scrum Technology
 3. None of them
 4. Scrum Framework
 5. Scrum People

##### Explain:

> ScrumMaster is not a people manager. Scrum does not prescribe any technology. Scrum is container framework within which techniques and technologies can be employed to develop complex products.

#### Question 28: What is the desirable team composition for large product development program?


 1. Program is divided into individual Scrums based on business feature. Each Scrum Team has all the skills needed to finish job without external help
 2. Program is divided into individual Scrums based on technical components. Each Scrum Team has its component specific skills needed to finish their own component without external help
 3. Program is organized into consumer Scrums and service provider Scrums (front end could be consumer who plays as Product Owner to a middle tier Scrum). Each Scrum gets the dependencies work done leveraging their Product Owner position

##### Explain:

> It is preferable to divide teams such that each team has absolute ownership of their work without external dependencies.

#### Question 29: When a Scrum Team adds new team members for replacing some members going out, the productivity of the team


 1. Will be negatively impacted
 2. Will be positively impacted
 3. Will remain the same

##### Explain:

> When new team members join, the productivity of the team will be temporarily reduced.

#### Question 30: Team Velocity refers to


 1. Average of amount of Product Backlog Items turned into "done" Items perSprint
 2. Average rate of churn of team members in Scrum Team during a Sprint
 3. Average number of defects per Sprint normalized over all defect types

#### Question 31: A Development Team decides to have an exclusive Sprint to evolve the technical architecture. The sole outcome of this Sprint is a finalized architecture design.


 1. It is a good practice since it will help the design to emerge
 2. It is not the Scrum approach, since every Sprint must produce at least one releasable functionality
 3. It does not matter, since the team is self-organized about how to perform their work

##### Explain:

> In Scrum, technical architecture is evolved continuously throughout the project, as more is learned. There is no exclusive Sprint or Scrum event to define the technical architecture upfront. Usually Development Team defines architectural guidelines that every team member can use in their work. The team can also have core hours to review the design and architecture during the Sprint. As a result, these guidelines are continually updated, and the technical design emerges on the go.

#### Question 32: In the middle of the Sprint, the Development Team finds that it has more capacity to take more work. The next best thing to do is


 1. Make it transparent to Product Owner immediately, and collaborate to add additional work.
 2. Consult and follow ScrumMaster’s and follow their direction
 3. Keep that as a contingency to accommodate unplanned work

##### Explain:

> Scrum events are time boxed. Sprint needs to be over by defined date. However, the scope of the Sprint may expand or contract as more is learned throughout the Sprint. When the work gets contracted due the new findings, and there is more room for additional work, the team makes it transparent to the Product Owner. ScrumMaster mentors the team to increase such transparency.

#### Question 33: Select all that apply. The Sprint Review is an event that requires


 1. Inspection and Adaptation activities
 2. Transition sign-off
 3. Stakeholders active participation
 4. Product Owner’s sign-off

##### Explain:

> Sprint Review is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration. There are no sign-offs.The Development Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it experienced, and how those problems were resolved. These discussions are not about technical problems, but those relating to understanding the Product Backlog Items, business and product issues that were uncovered, coherence or lack of coherence between the items, conflicts with previous Sprint implementations, and so on. These discussions will add more transparency.The Development Team demonstrates the work that is “Done” and answers questions about the Increment. They do not demonstrate any items that are incomplete.The participants collaborate on what to do next. They review how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed and what are the most valuable things to do next. They also review the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated product release.At the end, they come up with valuable input to the subsequent Sprint Planning by adapting the Product Backlog. A revised Product Backlog defines the probable Product Backlog Items for the next Sprint. However, the scope of the next Sprint is finalized only in the next Sprint Planning. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.

#### Question 34: Burn-up and Burn-down charts show evolution of progress over time. In particular


 1. Burn-up shows increase in team productivity, while Burn-down shows decrease in productivity
 2. Burn-up shows increase in completion, while Burn-down shows remaining effort
 3. Burn-up shows increase in turn-around time, while Burn-down shows decrease in turn-around time

##### Explain:

> Both burn-up and burn-down are not mandatory but optional in Scrum. They are used to make the progress transparent.

#### Question 35: A good guideline to differentiate Acceptance Criteria from definition of “Done” is, “definition of “Done” provides checklist to take the Increment close to production deployable state (potentially shippable), while acceptance criteria specify the business requirements”


 1. True
 2. False

##### Explain:

> Definition of “Done” is a standard to define the quality for production release. Acceptance criteria is the specification of expected business behavior.

#### Question 36: Select all that apply. Which Scrum events facilitate inspection and adaptation?


 1. Sprint Retrospective
 2. Backlog Refinement
 3. Sprint
 4. Development Work

##### Explain:

> Other than the “Sprint”, all other four events facilitate inspection and adaptation. Backlog Refinement is called as an Act within Scrum.

#### Question 37: Pick the Scrum Values


 1. Commitment and Openness
 2. Focus
 3. Creativity and Intuition
 4. Respect and courage
 5. Simplicity

##### Explain:

> Other answers also reflect Scrum. However, these five are the publicly understood version.

#### Question 38: The Development Team has not completed any of the Product Backlog Items selected for the Sprint by Sprint end. Next step is


 1. End the Sprint with a Retrospective, since Scrum favors "time boxing"
 2. Advice the Product Owner to accept the completed portion of the incomplete Product Backlog Items, and plan to complete them by next Sprint, since Scrum favors "empowered teams"
 3. Extend the Sprint since Scrum favors "getting done"

##### Explain:

> The Scrum events are strictly time boxed. They end as per the time box no matter what.						Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened.The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of that event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.What happens if a Development Team completes the work before the Sprint end?If a team completes the work before the Sprint end, they may collaboratively decide to do additional work such as refining the Backlog, etc. and still complete theSprint as planned. The Sprint duration is kept intact without contraction or expansion.But for the other four events, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, and Retrospective, if the team completes the intended agenda early, they can be closed early.

#### Question 39: Under this topic of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team is more active in planning and Product Owner is mostly observing or clarifying


 1. Topic One (What)
 2. Topic Two (How)
 3. Topic Three

##### Explain:

> In topic two, the Development Team puts together a plan of how to achieve the scope of the Sprint. It primarily involves deriving work tasks. As an owner who is going to own and perform these tasks, this team is more active during topic two.

#### Question 40: Middle of the Scrum, the team comes to know that there are some usage related changes to the Product needs. The Product Backlog


 1. Is not impacted and the Sprints continued
 2. Is modified to reflect the new need
 3. Is closed. Project is cancelled and new Product Backlog will be built

##### Explain:

> The Product Backlog is never complete during the project. It undergoes constant changes and continuously refined. It exploits emerging opportunities and adjusts the emerging risks, so the value can be optimized.

#### Question 41: In the middle of the Sprint, the Development Team did not get some technical tools that were originally promised. This will slow down the work. The next best thing to do is


 1. ScrumMaster should escalate to Project Manager
 2. Product Owner should cancel the Sprint
 3. The Development Team should assess the impact to meeting the Sprint Goal and the definition of “Done”, and find alternatives to still meet the Sprint Goal without compromising the definition of "Done"

##### Explain:

> The first step is to self-manage the issue and find workaround to preserve the Sprint Goal completion. If that does not solve the issue, it needs to be raised as an impediment seeking ScrumMaster’s help.

#### Question 42: Select all that apply. A Product Owner requests Development Team to help them with some tasks related to Product Backlog maintenance.


 1. Development Team should refer Product Owner to speak with Development Team manager
 2. It is okay but Product Owner is still accountable for the Product Backlog maintenance.
 3. Development Team can volunteer if this additional task does not impact their Sprint work
 4. The ScrumMaster should step in and coach Product Owner to perform their job themselves

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner may have the Development Team help them with Product Backlog maintenance. However, the Product Owner remains accountable. There is no manager for the Development Team.

#### Question 43: The Sprint Review is an opportunity to review


 1. All of the above
 2. Defects and causes
 3. Timeline and Budget
 4. Requirements and Capacity

##### Explain:

> Sprint Review is a Scrum event that offers an opportunity to inspect and adapt. Stakeholders collaborate to review the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product. The team also explains what happened during the Sprint. But they do not inspect about the defect and causes.

#### Question 44: What is the correct statement?


 1. The technical design continuously evolves over the Sprints. Hence the team should have some basic guidelines to start with, but try to emerge the design through the Sprints.
 2. The team can choose to have an exclusive Sprint only to finalize the technical design. At the end, the design should be approved by the project architect
 3. The team does not need to pay attention on the architecture as it will evolve itself as a by-product of self-organization

##### Explain:

> There is no exclusive Sprint only to finalize the design.Every Sprint must be used to produce at least one working functionality that is potentially releasable

#### Question 45: The Development Team tries to put together some guidelines on testing approach. Who will own these guidelines?


 1. Development Team
 2. Test Lead
 3. ScrumMaster

##### Explain:

> The testing approach is part of development work. The development work is owned by the Development Team.

#### Question 46: The Scrum Team gathers for Sprint Planning meeting. The Product Owner has some Product Backlog items but the Development Team finds that they do not provide enough information to understand the work involved to make forecast. The next best thing to do is


 1. The ScrumMaster cancels the Sprint
 2. The Scrum Team discusses the root cause in the retrospective
 3. The Development Team proceeds with starting with whatever is known
 4. The Development Team makes it transparent that they cannot make a forecast with insufficient information, and negotiates with Product Owner on refining theProduct Backlog items to ready state

##### Explain:

> The Development Team should maintain highest transparency while making a forecast of the work that they believe they could complete. In this case, they cannot do that because the Product Backlog items do not provide enough information. So, they have to utilize the time available to refine the items to required state and proceed with plan. Later, in the retrospective the Scrum does discuss the root cause and hence answer  ‘d’ is also correct. But, the question asks about “next best thing to do”.

#### Question 47: The Development Team meets every day to inspect the progress and adapt the next day plan. If the Daily Scrum exposes the need to re-plan rest of the Sprint, these re-planning activities happen


 1. The Sprint plan cannot be revised except during Sprint Planning
 2. As soon as the team gets some extra time
 3. Immediately after the Daily Scrum
 4. During the Daily Scrum

##### Explain:

> The Development Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress towards the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending towards completing the work in the Sprint Backlog. During the Daily Scrum they come up with the next 24 hour plan. But, if they see that the entire Sprint plan needs to revisited, they meet immediately after the Daily Scrum for detailed discussions, or to adapt, or re-plan, the rest of the Sprint’s work.

#### Question 48: For the Product Backlog Refinement act, the Scrum Team needs to define a recurring pre-set time every week outside the current working hours of Development Team.


 1. True
 2. False

##### Explain:

> This is an ongoing act that happens within the hours of current Sprint. The time can be mutually discussed and agreed by Product Owner and the Development Team. Usually it does not take more than 10% capacity of Development Team. Also, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.

#### Question 49: The Scrum Team, based on the learning from previous Sprints, decides to revisit the length of the Sprint. What is the appropriate Scrum event to discuss and agree on the change?


 1. Scrum Planning
 2. Sprint Planning
 3. Retrospective
 4. Daily Scrum

##### Explain:

> Retrospective is an event where the team inspects their way of working (people, relationships, process, and tools), and adapts any improvements.

#### Question 50: Multiple Development Teams are required to work on the same product. How can they integrate their development?


 1. by mutually working with each other to create an integrated Increment
 2. by setting up some common working sessions between the lead Developers of each team to merge their changes before the Sprint Review
 3. by maintaining individual Product Backlog for each team

##### Explain:

> Multiple teams working on the same product must have a single Product Backlog. It is the responsibility of all the teams to mutually define their definitions of “Done,” and then work with each other so that they can create an integrated Increment that is potentially shippable.

#### Question 51: How are the Non-Functional Requirements addressed by the Scrum Team?


 1. by testing them in 'Hardening Sprint'
 2. by ensuring that they are met by every Increment and typically defining them in the definition of "Done"
 3. By having a Non-Functional System Team owning them

##### Explain:

> Definition of “Done” defines the standards to be met for a Product Backlog item to be considered as “done.” Typically Non-Functional Requirements are added to the definition of “Done” so that such requirements are built into every Increment.

#### Question 52: ScrumMaster forecasts the Product burn-down during Sprint Review


 1. False
 2. True

##### Explain:

> It is responsibility of the Product Owner to track the progress of the Product Backlog and forecasts the completion. This forecasting is done in every Sprint Review.

#### Question 53: During Sprints, a Development Team has to wait for another team to provide some dependent input. Often this leads to delay in completing their work. What can be recommended to this team?


 1. The team can mock up the sample of input instead of waiting and do the SprintReview on time. The Product Increment can be refactored as and when another team provides input.
 2. The team should agree on Service Level Agreement (SLA) with another team and escalate to ScrumMaster if the SLA breached
 3. The team is not cross functional enough. The team should take ScrumMaster's help in educating the organization to add team members with appropriate skills

##### Explain:

> A Development Team should be cross functional enough, i.e., should have all the skills needed to convert the Product Backlog items into “done” Increment. If the team needs to depend on external entities for converting backlog items into done Increment, it is not cross functional enough. Every Sprint outcome should be potentially shippable. Mocking up does not complete the work as per that standard.

#### Question 54: Shortly into using Scrum for the first time in an organization, the Scrum Team runs into several impediments against following Scrum. The most common inference is


 1. Scrum does not work for their organization
 2. The Scrum Team didn’t plan the project end-to-end well in advance
 3. It is normal for first timers. Scrum will expose all weakness in the current ecosystem that impede developing Product Increments in short Sprints.

##### Explain:

> Scrum will expose all weakness in the current eco-system that need to be acknowledged and resolved by the organization.

#### Question 55: In Scrum based software development effort, while the Sprint Goal will deliver a Product Increment, one of the Product Backlog Items is asking for production of a document.


 1. It is not okay. Documentation is not needed until Product Owner chooses to release an Increment to production
 2. It is not okay. Every Product Backlog item must be about a working software requirement
 3. It is okay. A Sprint can produce other deliverables like document requested by Product Owner along with working Increment.
 4. It is okay. A Sprint can produce a document as a sole outcome of the Sprint

##### Explain:

> While the Sprint has to necessarily produce a potentially shippable and useable Increment, some of the Product Backlog items could produce other deliverables including documents if the Product Owner considers them having appropriate value. If a Product Backlog item is a document, it may not be subjected to definition of “Done” which is usually the standards needed for software. So, while the definition of “Done” is applicable at Increment level, it may not be applicable for some individual Product Backlog items.

#### Question 56: Scrum allows having gaps between two subsequent Sprints, in which the team can accomplish support activities and team building activities


 1. False
 2. True

##### Explain:

> Sprints are done consecutively, without intermediate gaps.

#### Question 57: A Scrum Team has five members. Each one works on a different product. What could we infer about the team?


 1. The team will have higher productivity since division of work is clear
 2. The potential of team work and benefit of Scrum is less
 3. All of them still will have common definition of “Done”
 4. The team implements diversity, a principle of Scrum

##### Explain:

> Since everyone is working on a different product, there is minimal chance of team work, collaboration and team self-organization.

#### Question 58: During a Sprint Review, the ScrumMaster notices that the Product Owner does not use the Product burn-down graph to explain the status to the stakeholders. The ScrumMaster


 1. Should coach the Product Owner on the importance of using this Scrum tool
 2. Should cancel the Sprint Review and schedule it back when the Product Owner is ready with this tool
 3. Do Nothing

##### Explain:

> There are many tools like product burn-down that help to show the evolution of the past and its projection into future. While they are useful, none of these tools are mandated by Scrum. ScrumMaster should strive to coach the team about importance of empiricism and not the tools.

#### Question 59: Velocity is an indication of team performance. It may be used by


 1. The Scrum Team an internal measure to plan and track their improvements.
 2. The managers to do performance appraisals for the team
 3. The organization to aggregate into organization level productivity

##### Explain:

> It is an optional standard, tracked by the Development Team for use within the Scrum Team.

#### Question 60: The role of ScrumMaster with respect to Scrum artifacts is


 1. Coach the team to increase the transparency of the artifacts
 2. Decide the format of the artifacts and ensures that the team follows it
 3. Owner of the artifacts and responsible for having them up to date

#### Question 61: To effectively track the Sprint progress, Scrum mandates


 1. Earned Value approach
 2. Increasing the transparency by frequently updating the remaining work
 3. Preparing Sprint burn down charts

##### Explain:

> Scrum does not mandate techniques like Sprint burn down or earned value. However, it stresses bringing-in highest transparency of the underlying information behind Scrum artifacts.

#### Question 62: Select all that apply. During the Daily Scrum, the ScrumMaster’s role is to:


 1. Facilitate discussions of the Development Team
 2. Moderate and control so that everyone gets a fair chance to speak
 3. All of the above
 4. Ensure that all 3 questions have been answered
 5. Teach the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15 minute time box

##### Explain:

> ScrumMaster facilitates the Scrum events as and when requested by others or required by their observations. ScrumMaster does not take any active role in directing or controlling the Daily Scrum. It is up to the Development Team to fully leverage it for their synchronization and progress. ScrumMaster is the guardian the Scrum process and time boxing is a cardinal rule of Scrum. So, ScrumMaster coaches the team to keep the Scrum rules.

#### Question 63: In a new Scrum Team, a ScrumMaster notices that a Developer works on a task that is not contributing to the Sprint Goal or the Sprint Backlog. The ScrumMaster


 1. Should escalate this to Product Owner
 2. Should discuss with team member and educate about Scrum way of working
 3. Should not interrupt since the team is self-organizing

##### Explain:

> The ScrumMaster does not manage people. They encourage the self-organization of the team to manage its work. However, the ScrumMaster is the guardian of the Scrum framework and hence its rules. A Development Team member should only work on tasks related to Sprint Goal. When there is a violation, ScrumMaster actively steps in to coach the team on Scrum.

#### Question 64: A person external to the Scrum Team with a specific interest in and knowledge of a product that is required for Incremental discovery, is known as


 1. Stakeholder
 2. Senior Management
 3. Technical/Domain Expert

##### Explain:

> Though stakeholder is generally regarded as those having some interest in the product, Scrum has this specific definition of the stakeholder.

#### Question 65: Middle of the Sprint, the Development Team finds that some of the Product Backlog Items forecast for this Sprint cannot be finished because they need significant additional effort. However, the Development Team can still meet Sprint Goal with rest of the items. The next thing to do is


 1. Do not cancel or modify the Sprint. Extend the Sprint duration as required for the additional effort
 2. Collaborate with the Product Owner to remove the Product Backlog Items that cannot progress, and new work up to team’s capacity. Complete the Sprint.
 3. Consult with Product Owner and if they agree, have them cancel the current Sprint, and plan new Sprint with new estimations

##### Explain:

> Cancelation of the Sprint is decided by Product Owner, and Product Owner will not cancel the Sprint unless the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Here the Sprint Goal is intact. Also, the Sprint duration cannot be extended since it is time boxed.

#### Question 66: The standard used by the Product Owner and the Scrum Team to identify unfinished work in a Sprint is


 1. Definition of Ready
 2. Testing Standard
 3. Definition of “Done”
 4. Coding Standard

##### Explain:

> Definition of “Done” provides the common understanding to the Scrum Team about how to assess the completion of a Product Backlog item or the Increment.

#### Question 67: A Scrum Team needs to develop a web application in Increments. Some of the Sprints have Sprint Goals like this: ‘Develop Data layer for Functionality A’. What is your inference?


 1. The Scrum Team follows horizontal decomposition of the Product Backlog items. This is recommended
 2. The Scrum Team follows vertical decomposition of the Product Backlog items.This is recommended
 3. The Scrum Team follows horizontal decomposition of the Product Backlog items. This is NOT recommended
 4. The Scrum Team follows vertical decomposition of the Product Backlog items.This is NOT recommended

##### Explain:

> It is preferable to decompose the Product Backlog items such that each team can produce fully working business functionality on its own rather than producing a technical component. Such decomposition is called as vertical decomposition. A horizontal decomposition on the other hand makes the team depend on other teams to integrate and create a fully working business functionality. Such teams usually end up as just technical component teams.

#### Question 68: A Development Team often gets some production support requirements, in addition to the work in the Sprint Backlog. The team adapted their team composition and created an exclusive sub team to support these ad-hoc requirements.


 1. It is okay if it is explicitly approved by ScrumMaster
 2. It is okay to create sub team within Scrum
 3. It is not okay since there cannot be sub teams within the Development Team.
 4. The team can complete the production support as one team, since it is high priority, and then come back to original Sprint work

##### Explain:

> Every Sprint is meant for delivering an Increment of releasable software / product, as required in Sprint Goal. If an outside item is taking the team’s time, it is treated as an issue. If the team is forced by any authority, ScrumMaster needs to coach these external authorities about how Scrum works, and facilitate removing this issue.

#### Question 69: A Development Team has technical specialists in its composition. The specialists perform their work when the Sprint Backlog needs their special skills, but they are idle otherwise.


 1. Continue to have the specialists to deliver fully integrated Increments. Gradually facilitate the Development Team to organize their work to fully leverage these special skills. If required, the team can enhance everybody’s domain of expertise, so everyone is productive as team without idle time
 2. Let the project manager coordinate their staffing needs and plan partial allocations to different teams to avoid idle time
 3. Defer and accumulate the special work to later Sprints until it needs full time specialists. Deliver the Increment with workarounds. Later, when specialists are added, refactor the Increment removing the workarounds so it can become releasable.

##### Explain:

> There is no project manager role in Scrum and the Development Team manages its own development work. A Development Team must be cross functional enough, that is, it should have all required special skills, without the need for any external help in completing the Sprint Backlog.

#### Question 70: The Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint because the Development Team modifies it throughout the Sprint. In the middle of the Sprint, new work is added to Sprint Backlog. As a result, estimated remaining work will


 1. Increase
 2. Decrease
 3. Stay the same

##### Explain:

> The Sprint estimation is not necessarily constant. As more is learned, the work is adjusted. When new work is added, it increases the amount of remaining work.

#### Question 71: A Development Team is responsible for


 1. Reporting to the ScrumMaster
 2. Increasing the productivity as per management goal
 3. Selecting the Product Backlog Items for the Sprint after clarifying with the Product Owner
 4. Creating a potentially shippable Increment every Sprint

#### Question 72: Scrum is immutable. What may be the result of an organization modifying Scrum Framework in its implementation for the convenience of existing culture?


 1. Scrum is bound by technical tools and these tools will break
 2. It can only be done with the help of Scrum coaches
 3. The organization may lose the opportunity to expose its current cultural dysfunctions that impede the ability to develop the Product Increment Sprint after Sprint.

##### Explain:

> Scrum does not prescribe or mandate any tools. There is no role such as Scrum coach.

#### Question 73: Which is true?


 1. Sprint Retrospective focuses on development process and Sprint Review focuses on Product
 2. Sprint Retrospective focuses on development process and Sprint Review focuses on Velocity
 3. Sprint Retrospective focuses on Product and Sprint Review focuses on development process

##### Explain:

> Sprint Review is a Scrum event to inspect and adapt the product development. Sprint Retrospective focuses on inspecting and adapting the way of working to develop the product.

#### Question 74: Three Development Teams are working as part of a big project to develop a product. When Sprints are in motion, there will be


 1. One Product Backlog, and three Sprint Backlogs
 2. Three Product Backlogs, and three Sprint Backlogs
 3. One Product Backlog and one Sprint Backlog

##### Explain:

> Since all of them work on a single product, there will be one common Product Backlog. But, each Development Team will have its own Sprint Backlog and Sprint Goal.

#### Question 75: An organization is on its path to adopt Scrum as its approach to software development. It decides to convert all Project Managers into ScrumMasters.


 1. The organization needs to rethink on this strategy. Identifying persons who are inclined or experienced in coaching and facilitation as their leadership style is a better strategy.
 2. It is good strategy. The project managers already know how to run projects. They just need training on Scrum
 3. It will create resentment to project managers, because they will have a small team to manage

##### Explain:

> ScrumMaster does not manage any team. The Scrum manager is not required to know project management since it is shared between three roles of Scrum.

#### Question 76: A Scrum Team often runs into following issues: Conflicting requirements from different departments, ad-hoc work requests from different business managers, no feedback on Increments. What could be the likely cause?


 1. Issues with how ScrumMaster guides the team
 2. Issues with Product Owner responsibilities
 3. Issues with planning abilities of Development Team

##### Explain:

> All these issues have something to do with collaborating with business stakeholders, maintaining Product Backlog, participating in Scrum events, etc. These are Product Owner’s responsibilities.

#### Question 77: The process of the coming into existence or prominence of new facts or new knowledge, or knowledge of a fact becoming visible unexpectedly, is called as


 1. Emergence
 2. Inspection
 3. Transparency

#### Question 78: When can a Product Owner negotiate the scope of what the team will work on next?


 1. Until the Sprint Planning for the current Sprint
 2. Both
 3. Anytime during the current Sprint with or without Development Team's consent

##### Explain:

> Scrum allows the Product Owner to decide what the team will work on next by ordering the Product Backlog items. In Sprint Planning, the team picks up these backlog items as the scope of the Sprint. However, after the Sprint Planning and until the Sprint end, the Product Owner cannot correct the Sprint Backlog without Development Team’s consent.						Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened.The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of that event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.If a team completes the work before the Sprint end, they may collaboratively decide to do additional work such as refining the Backlog, etc. and still complete theSprint as planned. The Sprint duration is kept intact without contraction or expansion.But for the other four events, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review, and Retrospective, if the team completes the intended agenda early, they can be closed early.

#### Question 79: A Scrum Team develops software. Only when the Product Owner decides to go for the release, the team creates end user documentation for the Product Increment at that point.


 1. It is correct. Creating document early will require constant effort to keep them updated.
 2. It is incorrect. Anything required for the Product Increment to be production fit must be part of definition of "Done"
 3. It is correct. Scrum favors less documentation and deferring the decision to last minute.

##### Explain:

> Every Increment is a potentially releasable Increment. It means that whatever is required for the release, it should be defined as part of definition of “Done”. For a Product Backlog item to be considered as ‘complete’, it should have met this definition of “Done”.
