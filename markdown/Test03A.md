# Test03 Answer

#### Question 1: John and Joseph are working in the same room. John is programming and Joseph is discussing with Kim. John gets to hear their conversation and gets enough information to know that Joseph has talked about some idea with Kim. What kind of communication is this referred to as?


 1. Active Listening
 2. Push Communication
 3. Osmotic Communication (CORRECT)
 4. Pull Communication

##### Explain:

> Osmotic communication occurs when people in the same environment hear and comprehends information without being communicated to directly.

#### Question 2: It is normal to have a “hardening” Sprint to remove all technical debt and prepare the Product for upcoming release.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> It is not normal. Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment is usable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it. So, there is nothing to prepare. Each increment contains only “Done” functionality that could be released immediately.

#### Question 3: Do company need to discuss the Scrum method with the customers and receive their approval to use Scrum in this project?


 1. Yes, because it increases our return on investment
 2. Yes, because it changes our delivery method (CORRECT)
 3. No, because it is our internal way of managing the project
 4. No, because it is acceptable nowadays to use Scrum

##### Explain:

> Scrum changes the way we are going to deliver the final product of the project, so we had better gain the approval of the customer to apply this Scrum method. They should be ready to receive the final product in small Increments and give regular feedback, instead of waiting for the project to finish and receive the final product as a whole.

#### Question 4: “We are going to decide on the length of Sprints. Some people believe it should be two weeks and some believe that it should be three weeks. What should we do?”


 1. Product Owner has the final saying on this
 2. Start the first Sprint anyway, and see how long it needs
 3. Start with either of them and change it later if needed (CORRECT)
 4. Scrum Master has the final saying on this

##### Explain:

> The most important point is that Sprints should be time-boxed. We can start with an initial duration and change it later; but it should always be time-boxed.

#### Question 5: Who should create the Sprint Goal?


 1. The Product Owner
 2. The Product Owner and the Development Team together
 3. The Development Team
 4. The ScrumMaster
 5. The Scrum Team (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Sprint Goal is created at the Sprint Planning meeting by the whole Scrum Team.

#### Question 6: Project A has 1000 Story Points and Project B has 600. Based on this, how much larger is project A over project B.


 1. 400 Story Points
 2. 40% larger
 3. You cannot compare the Story Points of two different projects (CORRECT)
 4. 66% larger

##### Explain:

> Since Story Points are relative comparisons based on stories specific to one project, they cannot be compared to another story.

#### Question 7: “Less than half of the Product Backlog (requirements) is recorded. The Product Owner thinks that it’s best to start the first Sprint with this information, rather than waiting for the whole Product Backlog to be completed. But he is not 100% sure that his thinking is correct. Who should help the Product Owner decide on the right action?”


 1. There’s no specific role for that, everyone should share the decision
 2. ScrumMaster (CORRECT)
 3. Development Team
 4. Marketing Manager

##### Explain:

> The ScrumMaster coaches everyone and helps them understand the way Scrum works.

#### Question 8: The Sprint time is going to end. Off the 8 items in the Sprint Backlog, only one is completely finished, three items are almost finished, and others are just 50% complete. Team Members realize that if they focus on the three almost finished items and extend the Sprint for only two days, they will be able to complete them too. What should we do?


 1. Expand the duration of Sprint, if customer accepts
 2. Do not expand the duration of the Sprint (CORRECT)
 3. Expand the duration of Sprint and complete the three items
 4. Expand the duration of Sprint, if both Scrum Master and Product Owner accept

##### Explain:

> Sprints are time-boxed. Being time-boxed means we cannot change the duration of any one Sprint based on the situation.

#### Question 9: It is a good practice to have from time to time a special technical Sprint that consists only of tasks removing the technical debt without implementing any new functionality.


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

##### Explain:

> It is prohibited. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality that adhere to the Scrum Team’s current definition of “Done.”

 1. The Development Team, alone
 2. The Scrum Master.
 3. The Product Owner with input from the Development Team.
 4. The Development Team after clarifying requirements with the Product Owner. (CORRECT)
 5. The most senior people in the organization, including architects and subject matter experts.

#### Question 11: What does the Development Team do in the first Sprint?


 1. Deliver an Increment of potentially shipable functionality (CORRECT)
 2. Fully plan for the whole project in detail
 3. Prepare a high level plan for the whole project

##### Explain:

> The goal of the Development Team in all Sprints (including the first one) is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionalities of the final product of the project. We don’t plan the whole project at the beginning, just enough for starting the immediate work. This planning is done when we are preparing and maintaining the Product Backlog and Sprint Backlogs.

#### Question 12: Everyone is disappointed with the small number of completed items in the first Sprint. The CEO asks the ScrumMaster for an explanation on who is responsible for this. What should the ScrumMaster reply regarding who is responsible?


 1. Product Owner has the primary responsibility
 2. Two of the Development Team members that were sick for a number of days during the Sprint are responsible
 3. The Development Team is responsible
 4. All three roles are responsible (CORRECT)

#### Question 13: What is the result of the Sprint Review?


 1. A list of improvements that the Scrum Team will implement in the next Sprint
 2. Common understanding of what can be delivered in the Increment and how will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved
 3. A revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint (CORRECT)
 4. Common understanding of progress toward the Sprint Goal and how progress is trending toward completing the work in the Sprint Backlog

##### Explain:

> The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.

#### Question 14: Which is the more important reason to demonstrate working product frequently?


 1. To get more feature out
 2. To accelerate our understanding of user's real needs (CORRECT)

#### Question 15: When do Development Team members become the exclusive owner of a Sprint Backlog item?


 1. Whenever a team member can accommodate more work.
 2. Never. All Sprint Backlog Items are "owned" by the entire Development Team, even though each one may be done by an individual development team member. (CORRECT)
 3. At the Sprint planning meeting.
 4. During the Daily Scrum.

##### Explain:

> Sprint Backlog and all of its items are collectively owned by the Development Team. No individual team member can claim ownership over an item as this would block communication and collaboration.

#### Question 16: How is the Product Backlog arranged?


 1. Into categories P1, P2, P3, etc

 2. Change those five items in the Sprint Backlog as soon as possible
 3. Do nothing, allow the Sprint to complete as normal

#### Question 71: Which of the following is NOT an advantage of limiting work in progress (WIP).


 1. It brings bottlenecks in the production process to the surface so they can be identified and resolved.
 2. It maximizes resource utilization to make processes work more efficiently (CORRECT)
 3. It helps optimize throughput to make processes work more efficiently
 4. It reduces the potential need to rework a large collection of flawed, partially completed items

##### Explain:

> Limiting WIP does reduce the potential need for rework. It also improves process efficiency and helps us find production bottlenecks. The only option listed here that is NOT an advantage of limiting WIP is the one that refers to maximizing resource utilization. Limiting WIP focuses on optimizing throughput, not resources, and we may actually decrease resource optimization to get more throughput.
