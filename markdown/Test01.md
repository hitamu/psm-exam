# Test01

#### Question 1: In the middle of the Sprint, a Development Team identifies a defect. Initially they were not sure about the cause of the defect, and hence they involved the Product Owner to discuss it. After the discussion, both the Product Owner and the Development Team agreed that the defect is indeed a clear gap in the feature being developed in their Sprint and not a new requirement.
