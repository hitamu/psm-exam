# Test05 Answer

#### Question 1: A Product Owner cannot send a representative (delegate) to the Sprint Review.


 1. False
 2. True (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> A Product Owner though they are accountable for Product Backlog, they can delegate many of the activities around Product Backlog Management, such writing them, ordering them, etc. However, they cannot delegate their participation in Scrum events.

#### Question 2: An important executive wants the Development Team to take in a highly critical feature in the current Sprint. The Development Team


 1. Will work on that since organization priority is more important
 2. Will ask the executive to work with Product Owner (CORRECT)
 3. As empowered team, will seek the executive to select an alternative work to be removed instead

#### Question 3: Only the Product Owner can come up with items that can be considered for the Product Backlog. Others cannot provide input / recommendations / ideas about new items.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> While the Product Owner has the final say on the content and order of the Product Backlog, they can get the input / recommendations / ideas about new items from any stakeholder or Scrum Team member for consideration. Correct answer is ‘False’.

#### Question 4: A discussion of what to do next is an additional event in the Sprint Review.


 1. False
 2. True, and the scope of the next Sprint is also finalized here.
 3. True, and it may capture probable Backlog Items for the next Sprint, but the scope of the next Sprint is deferred until Sprint Planning. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Every Scrum event is an opportunity for inspection and adaptation. In the Sprint Review, inspecting the product Increment provides insights and clarity. This newly found knowledge is used to ‘adapt the next steps,’ i.e., find out what to do next.

#### Question 5: A Development Team maintains a Sprint burn-down to track estimated remaining work. In the middle of the Sprint, the burn down graph shows an upward spike.This indicates


 1. A planned work is removed.
 2. The Product Owner added a new item to the Sprint.
 3. The Development Team added new work. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> A spike indicates added work. The Product Owner cannot add new work without the Development Team’s consent.

#### Question 6: In Sprint Review, along with the review of the product Increment and progress, “what (steps) to do next” is also discussed


 1. True, and the scope of the next Sprint is also finalized here
 2. True, and it may capture probable backlog items for next Sprint, but the scope of the next Sprint is deferred until Sprint Planning (CORRECT)
 3. False

##### Explain:

> Each Sprint event is an opportunity to inspect and adapt. “What to do next” is about adapting the Product Backlog if needed. The scope of the Sprint is finalized in the Sprint Planning, and not Sprint Review

#### Question 7: A Scrum Team decides that the frequency of Daily Scrum should be reduced to once per week.


 1. The Scrum Team is self-organized. They can choose their practices
 2. Self-organization is alright but such decisions need to be approved by agile coach. So, they should involve agile coach.
 3. Self-organization is about how to get the Sprint work done but subject to following Scrum. So, ScrumMaster should strive to coach the team on the essentials of Daily Scrum (CORRECT)

#### Question 8: Select all that apply. Empiricism provides…


 1. Frequent opportunities to get information using which uncertainty can be completely eliminated
 2. Frequent opportunities to discuss different possibilities (CORRECT)
 3. Frequent opportunities to make informed decisions, reducing risk (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Empiricism is alternative to waterfall to manage complexity and uncertainty. In waterfall, risk of uncertainty accumulates over long cycles. The risk is reduced by providing frequent feedback and course correction points, where more information may be available to view different possibilities and make informed decisions. However, empiricism does not completely eliminate uncertainty.

#### Question 9: At the end of Sprint Planning, the Development Team could not decompose all of the work into units of one day or less. It could decompose the work for only the first few days of the Sprint.


 1. The Development Team should close the Sprint Planning and start the work (CORRECT)
 2. Since the team is self-organized, they should continue Sprint Planning in the following days before they start the work
 3. The ScrumMaster should coach the team in required skills

##### Explain:

> The Sprint Planning is time boxed and cannot be extended. It is enough to have the work decomposed for first days of the Sprint to start the work, and can be decomposed later as needed throughout the Sprint.

#### Question 10: A Scrum Team needs to have the following roles. Select all that apply.


 1. Tester
 2. Project Leader
 3. Developer (CORRECT)
 4. Product Owner (CORRECT)
 5. Architect
 6. ScrumMaster (CORRECT)
 7. Business Manager
 8. Programmer
 9. Product Manager

##### Explain:

> Scrum contains only three roles. Anyone working in development, irrespective of their specialized skills such as architecture, testing, UI designing, coding, technical documenting, etc., is called a Developer. Correct answers are “Developer”, “ScrumMaster”, and “Product Owner”.

#### Question 11: In a Retrospective, a Scrum Team decides to revise the Sprint length. The new Sprint length needs to be agreed upon by the Product Owner.


 1. True (CORRECT)
 2. False

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner needs to ensure that the Sprint length is short enough to limit business risks and also short enough so the team can synchronize the development work with other business events. So it requires the approval of the Product Owner. Please note that the finalized Sprint length cannot be longer than 1 calendar month.

#### Question 12: During Daily Scrum, this plan is used as a reference to understand the changes in progress.


 1. Sprint Burn-down
 2. Product Backlog
 3. Sprint Backlog (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that changes in progress can be understood in the Daily Scrum

#### Question 13: What are the true statements?


 1. Scrum Team is responsible for formulating a Sprint Goal (CORRECT)
 2. When existing Product Backlog Items in the Sprint Backlog are modified, the Sprint Goal is bound to become invalid
 3. The coherence between Product Backlog items is made transparent by Sprint Goal. Lack of coherence will lead to Development Team members working individually (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Sprint Goal provides opportunity for team members to work together and offers some flexibility of adjusting the Product Backlog items when required. Development Team can modify the Product Backlog Items in the Sprint Backlog with Product Owner’s consent, such that the Sprint Goal will still be met.

#### Question 14: A Product Owner is also knowledgeable on technology. In addition to product requirements, they also impose some technical conditions that the product should meet. These conditions must be added to


 1. Definition of “Done” (CORRECT)
 2. Sprint Backlog
 3. Product Backlog

##### Explain:

> Every Product Backlog item should be about the product need that carries business value. The condition that Product Owner brings here is about the technical constraint. So, it should be added to the definition of “Done”.

#### Question 15: After Sprint Review, Production release in Scrum requires


 1. Non-Functional Testing
 2. None of the above (CORRECT)
 3. Usability/End User testing
 4. Hardening Sprints
 5. Architectural Validations
 6. All of the above

##### Explain:

> Every Sprint produces potentially releasable production quality Increment.

#### Question 16: For the first Sprint, the inputs are the Product Backlog and the Projected Capacity of the Development Team. What are the additional inputs to the subsequent Sprints?


 1. Past performance of the Development Team (CORRECT)
 2. Defect list from previous Sprint
 3. Sprint Plan
 4. Latest Product Increment (CORRECT)

#### Question 17: In the middle of the Sprint, a team member was required by another department manager to support an important task outside the Sprint work. What is recommended for the team member to do?


 1. The team member should ask the manager to speak with the ScrumMaster
 2. The team member should politely decline and explain the manager about his ownership and accountability for the Scrum Team (CORRECT)
 3. The team member must support since it is important task

##### Explain:

> Other than the “Backlog Refinement”, the Development Team should work on the tasks related to Sprint Goal. If any external authority brings different work, the team should explain about how they self-organize their work in Scrum way. After that, the team can refer them to speak with the Product Owner if the external authority still wants to add this new work

#### Question 18: In the middle of Sprint, the Product Owner wants the Development Team to participate in an important meeting with group of customers


 1. Development Team should strive to work on items related to current Sprint Goal. They should involve ScrumMaster who can educate Product Owner to defer such interruptions and if required plan them in next Sprint (CORRECT)
 2. Development Team should participate the meeting since it is with customers
 3. Development Team should stop current Sprint work until that meeting to ensure they clearly understand customer concerns

##### Explain:

> Other than the act of “Backlog Refinement”, each task that Development Team performs must be related to Sprint Goal. Any distraction should be avoided and if needed, ScrumMaster’s help needs to be sought to educate those causing the disruption

#### Question 19: Given a complex product and its relevance to multiple departments, a Scrum Team expects that they need to invite many stakeholders for the Sprint Review. It estimates that the review will take more than 4 hours. The Scrum Team can increase the Sprint Review duration.


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

##### Explain:

> Every Scrum event is time-boxed to reduce risk and eliminate waste. If there are valid reasons that require more time, it might be due to reasons such as added complexity. A team needs to address these root causes, and the time box should be followed to contain risks.More examples of where the time box is likely to be broken but should be safeguarded are

#### Question 20: When a Product Backlog is retired?


 1. When the Product Owner retires
 2. When the Product retires (CORRECT)
 3. When the Customer provides the sign-off on completion of the project
 4. When all the Sprints are over

##### Explain:

> A Product Backlog is a living artifact that lives as long the Product lives.

#### Question 21: The work left against time is shown by


 1. Team Velocity
 2. Release Burn-up
 3. Burn-down graph (CORRECT)
 4. Story Points Burn

#### Question 22: The organization or senior management’s support


 1. Is needed to support the Product Owner to maximize the product value and the ScrumMaster to coach and implement Scrum. (CORRECT)
 2. Is not needed because there is no scope for management in Scrum
 3. Is not needed for Scrum implementations

##### Explain:

> The organization or senior management’s support is a critical success factor for product planning and development in an empirical environment. Their action is needed to structure the self-organized teams.

#### Question 23: The architectural features of the product need to be


 1. Evolved along with Sprint deliveries (CORRECT)
 2. Completely designed upfront before the Sprints
 3. Decided at least at skeleton level in Sprint zero

##### Explain:

> Some teams may customize the Scrum to include iteration / Sprint zero before first Sprint, to do design. This is replacement of traditional “Big Upfront Design” of waterfall, and defeats the purpose of empiricism.

#### Question 24: What do the three C’s stand for in user stories?


 1. Card, Conversation, Classification
 2. Card, Communication, Confirmation
 3. Card, Classification, Conversation
 4. Card, Conversation, Confirmation (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The card is used to drive the conversation from which the acceptance tests or Confirmation is determined.

#### Question 25: A Development Team is self-organized and empowered. It is also the authority on deciding what business needs are required to be developed


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

#### Question 26: When a Sprint is cancelled, the Scrum Team discards all the work and refines a new Product Backlog


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

##### Explain:

> The team still conducts Sprint Review to review “Done” Product Backlog items. If part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it. All incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

#### Question 27: A Development Team in Scrum must be cross-functional. It means


 1. The team must divide their work according to subfunctions but sync up their work no later than the Sprint Review.
 2. The team must have all competencies needed to create the Increment as per the definition of “Done.” (CORRECT)
 3. The team must have a mix of team members from each of the different technology functions of the organization.
 4. Each team member must be cross-skilled.

##### Explain:

> Cross-skilling of team member is desirable but not mandatory. Required skills are decided by what is needed as per the definition of “Done” and not by an organization’s technology functions. The team works together every day not waiting for a last minute sync up.

#### Question 28: Scrum Team uses the information of Scrum artifacts to make ongoing decisions. The soundness of these decisions depends on


 1. artifacts’ Transparency (CORRECT)
 2. artifacts’ Adaptability
 3. artifacts’ Agility
 4. artifacts’ Format

##### Explain:

> Significant aspects of the development process must be visible to those responsible for outcome. These aspects must be highly transparent (should provide accurate and same understanding) so appropriate decisions can be taken

#### Question 29: Scrum framework consists of


 1. Scrum Standards
 2. Product Development Processes
 3. Scrum Teams (CORRECT)
 4. Roles, events, artifacts, and rules associated with Scrum Teams (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Though there are standards such as definition of “Done”, they are not formally called as Scrum Standards.

#### Question 30: To deliver a single product, three different Development Teams are formed. How many Product Owners are needed?


 1. Three
 2. One (CORRECT)
 3. As many as recommended by ScrumMaster

##### Explain:

> A single product should have a single Product Backlog and hence the only one owner, a Product Owner. A Product Owner can delegate some of his responsibilities to the team, however they are still accountable for Product Backlog ownership

#### Question 31: Who decides the duration of the Sprint?


 1. Product manager
 2. ScrumMaster
 3. Development Team
 4. Scrum Team (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The final Sprint duration, i.e., how much shorter than one month, is decided by the Scrum Team after considering the need of the Product Owner to limit business risks and the need of the Development Team so they can synchronize the development work with other business events.

#### Question 32: Every Sprint, the working Increment should be tested progressively from unit testing, to integration testing, and then user acceptance testing.


 1. Yes. It is the prescribed method
 2. No. The test strategy is decided by the Quality Assurance Lead in the team
 3. Not necessary. While the team needs to ensure that each Increment is thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together, and meets definition of “Done”, it is up to the team to find best method to achieve this (CORRECT)
 4. Incorrect. It should also include non-functional testing.

##### Explain:

> The team is self-organizing its own work. They can employ approaches and techniques that provide best return on effort.

#### Question 33: During the Daily Scrum, a team member says he does not know when his task will be complete.


 1. Replace the team member with new team member
 2. It is acceptable as Sprint Review date is far away
 3. ScrumMaster to mentor the team member on how to estimate the task
 4. Development Team should collaborate to plan alternative steps such as pairing with someone else, etc. to eliminate the risk of not meeting Sprint Goal. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The highest priority of Development Team is to complete the Sprint Goal. If there are impediments, they need to be resolved either directly or using workarounds. Later, in retrospective, the cause of this impediment can be discussed to find potential improvements

#### Question 34: Conducting the Daily Scrum at the same time and same place every day makes it easier for the Product Owner and the ScrumMaster to participate.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> It is preferable to conduct the Daily Scrum at the same time and same place so it can reduce the complexity of meeting overhead. Unless the Product Owner and ScrumMaster are also part of the Development Team, they are not required for the Daily Scrum.

#### Question 35: Select all that apply. Scrum Team participates in


 1. Sprint Planning (CORRECT)
 2. Daily Scrum
 3. Sprint Review (CORRECT)
 4. Sprint Retrospective (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Scrum Team participates in all events except Daily Scrum. Only the Development Team participates in that event, because, it organizes, plans, and controls its work without direction or management by Product Owner or ScrumMaster. ScrumMaster can participate if there is a need to coach or facilitate, until the Development Team can do on its own.

#### Question 36: What are the true statements?


 1. Only the Product Owner can change the Sprint Backlog
 2. Only the Product Owner should cancel the Sprint. Others can influence the decision to cancel. (CORRECT)
 3. Only the Development Team should be responsible for estimates of Product Backlog Items (CORRECT)
 4. Only the Product Owner should update the Product Backlog without delegating to anyone

#### Question 37: A Scrum Team can identify the improvements only during the Sprint Retrospective


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

##### Explain:

> Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation. However, improvements may be identified and implemented any time.

#### Question 38: A Development Team identifies a technical issue that requires them to work together to solve this. Who needs to facilitate this?


 1. Development Team (CORRECT)
 2. ScrumMaster
 3. Product Owner

##### Explain:

> A Development Team is responsible for performing development work and meeting the Sprint Goal. If they have any issue that is within their influence to solve, they are responsible for resolving it. The ScrumMaster is responsible for impediments that are outside the Development Team’s influence.

#### Question 39: A Scrum Team must produce the following artifacts. Select all that apply.


 1. Sprint Backlog (CORRECT)
 2. Design Document
 3. Product Backlog (CORRECT)
 4. Test Case Specifications
 5. Increment (CORRECT)
 6. Project Plan
 7. Project Status Report

##### Explain:

> A Scrum Team produces and maintains artifacts that help them to plan their work, track their progress, and share the information visibly to required stakeholders. In that respect, Scrum mandates only three artifacts. Notice that the Increment is not a document but a working product Increment. Correct answers are “Product Backlog”, “Sprint Backlog”, and “Increment”.Other artifacts or documents are optional and can be chosen by the team if they add value to their work or the final product.

#### Question 40: A customer wants to communicate something very relevant and important about the product to the Development Team. Who should they talk to?


 1. Development Team only
 2. Since everyone on the team is accountable for product development, the customer should meet all of them together.
 3. Product Owner only (CORRECT)
 4. ScrumMaster only

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee or customer in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.

#### Question 41: A Scrum Team is in the process of defining Product Backlog items. The ScrumMaster notices that the team is not using User Story format to capture the backlog items. ScrumMaster should


 1. let the team decide the format of Product Backlog items (CORRECT)
 2. correct the team’s behavior by coaching them about user stories
 3. add a business analyst with knowledge of writing user stories to the team, with specific responsibility of documenting backlog in terms of user stories

##### Explain:

> Scrum does not prescribe any specific technique to capture the Product Backlog items. The team can choose the most beneficial technique that works for them.

#### Question 42: One of the Scrum Teams chose to have a Development Team member also playing the role of ScrumMaster. A Development Team member cannot also play ScrumMaster’s role.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> A ScrumMaster can be a Development Team member but that is not mandatory

#### Question 43: In a Scrum Team, only the Product Owner communicates with the stakeholders.There is no exception to this rule.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Stakeholders only communicate with the Product Owner with respect to Product Planning, its Progress, and the Product Backlog changes. In addition, the ScrumMaster can also work with the stakeholders to make them understand Scrum. Also, the entire Scrum Team collaborates with stakeholders during the Sprint Review.

#### Question 44: The leadership model followed by ScrumMaster is


 1. Servant Leadership (CORRECT)
 2. Command and Control
 3. Micro Management

##### Explain:

> The ScrumMaster is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team

#### Question 45: The value attached to the Product Backlog Item is guaranteed to be realized.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The value is an estimate based on assumptions. It has to be validated by releasing the item. Scrum facilitates the early validation by making it available as a potentially releasable and useable Increment to the Product Owner who can then choose to release it to Production.

#### Question 46: When more Scrum Teams are added to a project that works on one single product, the productivity of the original Scrum Teams mostly likely will increase


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

##### Explain:

> Each Scrum Team needs to mutually define their definition of “Done” so their combined work will be potentially releasable. This involves some overhead work in syncing up, and hence the impact to productivity

#### Question 47: Scrum is


 1. A body of knowledge on software engineering to build products
 2. Collection of industry best practices in information technology
 3. A framework to address complex adaptive problems (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Scrum is a framework based on empiricism process control theory within which people can address complex adaptive problems.

#### Question 48: Who performs inspections of work in Scrum?


 1. Development Team (CORRECT)
 2. External Audit Team
 3. ScrumMaster in defined inspection points

##### Explain:

> The Development Team is responsible for inspecting its own work.

#### Question 49: You are in a Scrum Team that is in the middle of the Sprint. Your team gets some additional team members. The likely result is:


 1. The team may suffer in its productivity (CORRECT)
 2. The team will have to do Sprint Planning again and get buy-in from new members on the new planning
 3. The team can take more stories on the top of originally forecast Sprint Backlog

##### Explain:

> The productivity will not increase because there will be learning curve for new members. The Sprint cannot be aborted to go back to Sprint Planning. The Sprint can be cancelled only by the Product Owner upon their inference that the Sprint Goal is not valid anymore

#### Question 50: Definition of “Done” is


 1. Initially defined per product by Scrum Team, but may change throughout the product development duration (CORRECT)
 2. Initially defined per Scrum Team, and does not change
 3. Defined after first Sprint based on the new insights obtained from first Sprint Review

#### Question 51: You are working as a ScrumMaster on a team. Your organization plans to conduct a road show on Scrum across the board. You are asked to contribute to some related events.


 1. As a leader, you will delegate this to some other team members so that they can benefit from the learning and visibility.
 2. You will politely refuse because you are working as a ScrumMaster on a team that is fully focused on delivering the Sprint Goal.
 3. You will gladly volunteer because being a ScrumMaster in an organization also involves the responsibility of coaching the organization. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> One of the ScrumMaster’s responsibilities is coaching Scrum to the organization.

#### Question 52: As per empiricism, knowledge is acquired by


 1. Formal Teaching
 2. Analytical tools
 3. Experience (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience in the past and the practice of making decisions based on what is known.

#### Question 53: A Scrum Team is at the end of a Sprint. The next Sprint starts


 1. Only after the product Increment is released to production
 2. Only after the Retrospective event of the current Sprint (CORRECT)
 3. Only after the team for the next Sprint is on board
 4. Only after the Sprint Planning

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner may choose to release to production, but it is not mandatory.The same team will continue to the next Sprint. Sprint Planning is the first event of the Sprint. The last event of the Sprint is the Retrospective.

#### Question 54: To reduce the likelihood of not meeting big commitments, Scrum uses


 1. Timeboxing, so the events cannot exceed a predetermined time box (CORRECT)
 2. Timeboxing, so the commitments will have additional buffer of time
 3. Timeboxing, so the planned events can happen on time

##### Explain:

> Scrum controls the risk associated with long term planning and big commitments by constraining the product development into shorter iterations called Sprints.Each Sprint is strictly time-boxed so they expire on the predetermined date no matter what. By timeboxing, the risk of pursuing a wrong direction is limited to the cost of one Sprint.

#### Question 55: During a Sprint Review, the stakeholders notice that the product development progress is not clearly visible and lacked transparency. Moreover, they are not able to understand the next steps. Who is responsible for this?


 1. Scrum Team
 2. ScrumMaster
 3. Product Owner (CORRECT)
 4. Development Team

##### Explain:

> Product Owner is responsible for maintaining the transparency of Product Backlog, the progress so far, and the next steps along with alternatives if any.

#### Question 56: An organization decides to have small Development Teams of size fewer than three. The likely result could be


 1. All of the above (CORRECT)
 2. The team may have low productivity gains
 3. The team may have skills shortage
 4. The team may have decreased interaction

##### Explain:

> While the Development Team should be small enough to be nimble, fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Smaller Development Teams may encounter skill constraints during the Sprint, causing the Development Team to be unable to deliver a potentially releasable Increment.

#### Question 57: Which is not a Product Backlog Management activity?


 1. Clearly expressing and ordering Product Backlog items
 2. Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
 3. Using formal change control to manage Product Backlog when market provides feedback from Product usage. (CORRECT)
 4. Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

##### Explain:

> Changes in business requirements, market conditions, or technology may cause changes in the Product Backlog. Product Owner keeps the Product Backlog updated as a living artifact to reflect these changes, without a formal change control process.

#### Question 58: In the middle of the Sprint, the Development Team finds that some of the Product Backlog Items forecast for this Sprint cannot be finished because they need significant additional effort. However, the Development Team can still meet the Sprint Goal with rest of the items. The next thing to do is


 1. Remove the Product Backlog Items that cannot be finished. Collaborate with the Product Owner to add new work up to team’s capacity. Complete the Sprint. (CORRECT)
 2. Do not cancel or modify the Sprint. Extend the Sprint duration as required for the additional effort.
 3. Consult with the Product Owner and if they agree have them cancel the current Sprint and plan a new Sprint with new estimates.

##### Explain:

> As a first step, the team needs to capture this as an impediment and try to solve it on its own. If they cannot, they should work with the ScrumMaster. After that, if the impediment is not solved, they need to involve the Product Owner.

#### Question 59: Sprint longer than one calendar month may result in


 1. Detached stakeholders
 2. All of the above (CORRECT)
 3. Increased complexity needing more traditional controls like documentations
 4. Too much to inspect in short meetings

##### Explain:

> The longer the Sprint length, the work practices tend to drift towards waterfall style: with lengthy meetings, lack of early feedback from stakeholders, documentation/communication needs due to increasing complexity

#### Question 60: The senior management or organization does not influence the Product Owner on how the product evolves in any way.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The senior management and the organization set the larger strategies of organizational change. Such strategies may influence the product development.In addition, the organization enables the Product Owner to obtain information that will help them increase the value of the product and capabilities. When required, they directly engage the Product Owner in setting up expectations of the product.So, though they do not play any active role within Scrum on product development, they influence it through other means.

#### Question 61: The product development project is about delivering an internal feature for an organization. The team has good skill composition and worked in similar projects. The Sprint lengths can be


 1. Up to one calendar month (CORRECT)
 2. Ignored since it is internal project
 3. Decided after the first release

##### Explain:

> Sprint length should be decided for all Sprints including for the first Sprint. Sprints are limited to one calendar month. Product Owner’s input need to sought to verify that the business risk due to this Sprint length is acceptable to them. In this case, since the team is cross-functional and experienced, risk appears to be lower. So it can be shorter.

#### Question 62: A Scrum Team needs to develop a web application in Increments. Some of the Sprints have Sprint Goals like this: ‘Develop Data layer for Functionality A’. What is your inference?


 1. The Scrum Team follows horizontal decomposition of Product Backlog items. This is recommended
 2. The Scrum Team follows vertical decomposition of Product Backlog items. This is recommended
 3. The Scrum Team follows vertical decomposition of Product Backlog items. This is NOT recommended
 4. The Scrum Team follows horizontal decomposition of Product Backlog items. This is NOT recommended (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> It is preferable to decompose the Product Backlog items such that each team can produce useable business functionality instead of producing a technical component. Such decomposition based on useable business functionality is also called as vertical decomposition. A horizontal decomposition on the other hand makes the team as technical component team that will have external dependencies.

#### Question 63: After Sprint Planning, the Product Backlog Items selected into the Sprint Backlog are frozen and cannot be modified. The only way to modify the Sprint Backlog is to have the Product Owner cancel the Sprint.


 1. False (CORRECT)
 2. True

##### Explain:

> The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

#### Question 64: What is a key inspect and adapt meeting for the Development Team?


 1. Project Status Meeting
 2. Daily Scrum (CORRECT)
 3. Design Sessions

##### Explain:

> Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify impediments to development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Team’s level of knowledge. This is a key inspect and adapt meeting for Development Team.

#### Question 65: Scrum framework is founded on


 1. Empiricism (CORRECT)
 2. Empiricism and Technical Practices
 3. Empiricism and Emotional Intelligence

##### Explain:

> Technical practices or any other value adding techniques can be optionally chosen by the Team and followed within the Scrum framework. However they do not reflect the foundation of Scrum.

#### Question 66: An important executive wants the Development Team to include a highly critical feature in the current Sprint. The Development Team


 1. As an empowered team, it will negotiate with the executive and identify an alternative backlog item in scope for current Sprint that may be removed to accommodate this critical feature.
 2. Will ask the executive to work with the Product Owner. (CORRECT)
 3. Will work on that feature since an organization’s priority is more important.

##### Explain:

> The Development Team should only work on the items related to the Sprint Goal. No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.

#### Question 67: Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply


 1. After Sprint Planning, a sprint can proceed without complete Sprint Backlog (CORRECT)
 2. After Sprint Planning, a sprint cannot proceed without complete architecture
 3. After Sprint Planning, a sprint cannot proceed without complete requirement specification
 4. After Sprint Planning, a sprint cannot proceed without a Sprint Goal (CORRECT)

#### Question 68: Select all that apply. Within just few Sprints, Scrum increases the transparency of the following


 1. Information of real progress
 2. Both (CORRECT)
 3. Technical ability of team to create Product Increment

##### Explain:

> Since a Sprint fully completes one full cycle of development activities including Sprint Planning, developing, delivering a releasable Increment, etc. it brings out lot of useful information and transparency

#### Question 69: A Product Owner is not available for Scrum events and not supportive enough for Development Team. The next immediate accountability is with


 1. ScrumMaster, who needs to educate Product Owner on his role (CORRECT)
 2. Product Owner’s manager who needs to engage the Development Team and understand their problems
 3. Development Team that needs to cancel the Sprint
 4. Stakeholders that need to get a written commitment from Product Owner

##### Explain:

> ScrumMaster has the responsibility to remove Development Team’s impediment and coach every role. Also, ScrumMaster can show the resultant poor results due to lack of Product Ownership to Product Owner during retrospective.

#### Question 70: Who defines the definition of “Done”?


 1. Scrum Team
 2. Product Owner
 3. Development Team (CORRECT)
 4. Technical / Domain Experts

##### Explain:

> It is developed by the Development Team with conditions that are acceptable to Product Owner.

#### Question 71: Since the Scrum Team is self-organizing, it can create an additional role to represent the organization within Scrum.


 1. True
 2. False (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Scrum has only three roles. The organization needs are best represented in the Product Backlog which is available and visible to the required stakeholders in an organization.

#### Question 72: The role of ScrumMaster in Sprint Retrospective is


 1. Auditor
 2. Silent Observer
 3. Peer Team Member (CORRECT)
 4. None of the above

##### Explain:

> One of the items reviewed in retrospective is the “implementation of Scrum framework.” Since ScrumMaster is the owner for that, they participate as a peer team member

#### Question 73: An inspector finds that a work aspect deviates outside acceptable limits, and that the resulting product will be unacceptable. When will the team adjust this work aspect to minimize the deviation?


 1. After the ScrumMaster approves the adjustment
 2. In the next Scrum event
 3. As soon as possible (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Development Team does not wait for any formal event to make this adjustment; instead make it as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

#### Question 74: Who finalizes the number of Product Backlog Items that can be selected for the Sprint Backlog?


 1. The Product Owner since they optimize the Development Team’s work
 2. The ScrumMaster since they coach the team on Scrum
 3. The Scrum Team together negotiates and reaches an agreement. They may use the team velocity as a standard to calculate how much work they can take.
 4. The Development Team since they are the owners of the work (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Product Owner optimizes the team’s work by keeping the Product Backlog ordered, and hence deciding what they work on next. Only the Development Team can finalize how many Product Backlog Items it can complete in the Sprint.

#### Question 75: Duration (length) of the Sprint is decided by


 1. Product Owner
 2. ScrumMaster
 3. Scrum Team (CORRECT)

#### Question 76: A Scrum Team crafts the following Sprint Goal: “All the Sprint code should have passed 100% automated unit tests”.


 1. Not an appropriate goal, since Sprint Goal should be about expected business value (CORRECT)
 2. It is well formed Sprint Goal
 3. It is incorrect, since Product Owner formulates the goal and not the Scrum Team

##### Explain:

> Sprint Goal reflects the intended business functionality that will be delivered in a Sprint.

#### Question 77: Select all that apply. The formal opportunities for Inspection and Adaptation are


 1. Product Increment
 2. Definition of “Done”
 3. None of the above (CORRECT)
 4. Sprint

##### Explain:

> Four Scrum events are formal events for inspection and adaptation. They are Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Review and Retrospective.

#### Question 78: In the early days of a Product Development’s initial Sprint, the Product Backlog


 1. Only lays out the initially known and best-understood requirements. (CORRECT)
 2. Is as comprehensive as required to complete the Product.
 3. Is not shared with the Development Team until it is supplemented with other required specifications.

##### Explain:

> In the beginning, the Product Backlog only lays out the initially known and best-understood requirements. The Product Backlog is a living artifact that evolves and constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful.

#### Question 79: The primary objective behind why a ScrumMaster ensures that the Scrum Team and those interacting with the Team from the outside adhere to the Scrum rules is


 1. To preserve the hierarchy of reporting and communication protocol.
 2. To maximize the value created by the Scrum Team. (CORRECT)
 3. To avoid the likelihood of future audits finding any violations in implementing Scrum.

##### Explain:

> It is the ScrumMaster’s responsibility to ensure that outside interactions do not distract the Team from making progress in the Sprint, and change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

#### Question 80: An increment is


 1. The sum of Product Backlog Items selected into Sprint Backlog
 2. The sum of the value of all increments from previous iterations integrated with the Product Backlog Items “done” in latest Sprint (CORRECT)
 3. The sum of Product Backlog Items “done” in latest Sprint

##### Explain:

> The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints
