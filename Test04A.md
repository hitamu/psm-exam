#### Question 1: A line in the Agile Manifesto reads, “____________ over following a plan”. Please select which option best completes the statement.


 1. Asking the customer
 2. Responding to change (CORRECT)
 3. Communicating frequently
 4. Completing requirements

##### Explain:

> SummaryA line in the Agile Manifesto reads, “Responding to change over following a plan”. This is intended to mean that Agile development is highly adaptive and focused on quick responses to change and continuous development.

#### Question 2: Your are the ScrumMaster for five Scrum teams which have a combined total of three Product Owner. The Scrum teams are assigned to work on different components of the same product. How should you setup the Sprint cycle to execute Scrum?


 1. Each Team should have the same Sprint duration and the same start dates. (CORRECT)
 2. Each unique combination of Product Owner and Team should have the same Sprint duration and the same start dates.
 3. Each Team should have the same Sprint duration but different start dates.
 4. Each unique combination of Product Owner and Team should have the same Sprint duration but different start dates.

##### Explain:

> In this scenario, everyone should be on the same Sprint duration with the same dates because it is the same product. It does not matter how many Scrum teams exist or how many Product Owners exist. This is a scenario in which the company is multi-tasking rather than sequentially building each product component.

#### Question 3: From the activities given, which is the latest step in sequence of the Scrum framework?


 1. Sprint retrospective (CORRECT)
 2. Sprint review
 3. Daily scrum
 4. Sprint planning

##### Explain:

> The first activity of each Sprint is a Sprint planning meeting. The last activity of each Sprint cycle is the Sprint retrospective.

#### Question 4: Which of the following is not a Scrum artifact?


 1. Product Backlog
 2. Sprint Backlog
 3. Burndown Chart
 4. Gantt Chart (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> A Gantt Chart is not a scrum artifact. All other items are valid artifacts.

#### Question 5: You are the ScrumMaster. The Sprint will complete in two days. Each day of the Sprint is equivalent to 8 hours. The team has just enough time to complete all tasks in the remaining 16 hours with the exception of three tasks. Of these three tasks, two tasks (a total of 6 hours) are required to complete one Product Backlog item and one task (an estimate of 2 hours) is required to complete another Product Backlog item. How should the team handle the remaining three tasks?


 1. The team should place the two Product Backlog items back onto the Product Backlog. (CORRECT)
 2. The team should negotiate with the Product Owner on the definition of "done".
 3. The team should keep the three tasks on the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint and complete those tasks first.
 4. The team should work the extra 8 hours to complete their commitment to the Product Owner.

##### Explain:

> The team should place the two Product Backlog items back onto the Product Backlog. The product Owner must determine what the priority of this unfinished work should be in relation to other prioritized work. Please remember that the team must work at a sustainable pace. Overtime is not a part of Scrum.

#### Question 6: Which of the following is not a responsibility of the Team?


 1. Monitoring and optimizing the work to meet the Sprint goal at least daily.
 2. Resolving internal conflicts.
 3. Planning how to meet a Sprint goal.
 4. Monitoring and increasing productivity and learning. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The Team is not responsible for monitoring and increasing productivity and learning. Whoever manages the team is responsible for monitoring and increasing productivity and learning. This will most likely be the Project Manager who may be accountable for hiring, costs, and training.

#### Question 7: How many principles form the foundation of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development?


 1. 15
 2. 12 (CORRECT)
 3. 9
 4. 10

##### Explain:

> There are 12 principles that form the foundation of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.						– Customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of useful software						– Welcome changing requirements, even late in development						– Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)						– Working software is the principal measure of progress						– Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace						– Close, daily co-operation between business people and developers						– Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)						– Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted						– Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design						– Simplicity						– Self-organizing teams						– Regular adaptation to changing circumstances

#### Question 8: From the activities given, which is the third step in sequence of the Scrum framework?


 1. Sprint retrospective
 2. Daily scrum
 3. Sprint planning
 4. Sprint review (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> The first activity of each Sprint is a Sprint planning meeting. The scrum begins in the second half of the scrum planning meeting. The daily scrum happens every day of the Sprint. The completed tasks are reviewed at the end of the Sprint in the Sprint review meeting. The Sprint retrospective is held last to discuss any possible improvements to introduce into the Sprint.

#### Question 9: How should items in the Product Backlog be ordered?


 1. Chronologically by date of original business request first and then by list order in the Product Backlog
 2. Alphabetically by the business unit first and then by list order in the Product Backlog
 3. Grouped by business features first and then chronologically by date of original business request.
 4. Prioritized across all business units and features first and then by list order in the Product Backlog. (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Items in the Product Backlog must be first ordered by priority. If a single scrum team is working on requests from multiple Product Owners representing different business units, then the Product Owner are responsible for determining which Product Backlog Item has the highest priority. If there are multiple items of the same priority, then order of appearance on the list is used.

 1. Product Backlog items should be sorted by level of effort or complexity in descending order.
 2. Product Backlog items should be grouped by business category or feature.
 3. Product Backlog items should be sorted by business priority in descending order. (CORRECT)
 4. Product Backlog items should be date sorted in ascending order.

##### Explain:

> Product Backlog items should be sorted by business priority in descending order. The Product Owner must constantly reprioritize the list as more information is learned.

#### Question 13: A(n) __________________ is the effort estimation for a Product backlog item and is assigned at the before the Sprint begins.


 1. LOE
 2. Business Value
 3. SWAG
 4. Storypoint (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> A storypoint is the effort estimation for a Product backlog item and is assigned at the before the Sprint begins.

#### Question 14: The Sprint time is going to end. Off the 8 items in the Sprint Backlog, only one is completely finished, three items are almost finished, and others are just 50% complete. It’s time for Sprint Review. Team Members believe that they should only demonstrate the one completed item, but the Product Owner believes that they should also demonstrate the three items that are almost finished. What’s the right choice?


 1. The Product Owner is right, given that they will mention in the Sprint Review that those three items are not completed yet but will be done in the near future
 2. The Team Members are right (CORRECT)
 3. The Product Owner is right as near completed products can also be shown

##### Explain:

> Only the 100% “Done” items are to be demonstrated; even the 99.999% doneitems should not be presented to the customer.

 1. Fixed price
 2. Customer collaboration (CORRECT)
 3. Satisfied customer
 4. Supply and demand

##### Explain:

> A line in the Agile Manifesto reads, “Customer collaboration over contract negotiation”. This is intended to mean that requirements cannot be fully collected at the beginning of the software development cycle, therefore continuous customer or stakeholder involvement is very important.

#### Question 20: _________________ is an Agile development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements by executing frequent “releases” in short development cycles (time-boxing), by programming in pairs or conducting extensive code reviews, by unit testing all code, and by maintaining a flattened management structure.


 1. Lean
 2. Agile Modelling
 3. Scrum
 4. XP (CORRECT)

##### Explain:

> Extreme Programming is an Agile development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements by executing frequent “releases” in short development cycles (time-boxing), by programming in pairs or conducting extensive code reviews, by unit testing all code, and by maintaining a flattened management structure.

#### Question 21: Development Team membership should change:


 1. Every Sprint to promote shared learning
 2. Never, because it reduces productivity.
 3. As needed, while taking into account a short term reduction in productivity. (CORRECT)
 4. As needed, with no special allowance for changes in productivity

##### Explain:

> Teams typically go through some steps before achieving a state of increased performance. Changing membership typically reduces cohesion, affecting performance and productivity in the short term.

#### Question 22: We couldn’t finish most of the Sprint Backlog items in the past two Sprints. What should we do?


 1. None of the above
 2. Both of the above as we are still deciding on the correct time for each Sprint (CORRECT)
 3. Increase the length of the future Sprints
 4. Reduce the capacity of Sprints

##### Explain:

> In order to be able to finish all Sprint Backlog items in time, it seems like we need less planned work and more time in each Sprint. We prefer not to change the time-box of Sprints, but since we were not sure about the proper duration from the beginning and were only testing a duration, it’s a good idea to change it too.

#### Question 23: In agile, when should you collect lesson learnt?


 1. At the end of the project
 2. When projects go poorly

 1. Tasks (CORRECT)
 2. Features
 3. Use Cases
 4. Stories

##### Explain:

> Tasks constitute the Sprint Backlog and are often estimated in hours. Alternate choices: Use cases are used for either requirements. A task may be to create use cases. Stories, also known as Storycards, are what may be used to document the product backlog item. Features requested by Product Owners are generally expressed in the Product Backlog as one or more storycards.

#### Question 25: Which of the following is not a Product Owner responsibility?


 1. Gathering requirements for Product Backlog items
 2. Working with stakeholders to determine and detail product features
 3. Inspecting work at Sprint Review
